This project aims to analyze global energy production, specifically comparing green energy and fossil fuel energy production. Using R, the project explores how the increased production of green energy might impact the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and examines the potential improvement in air quality as a result. The study is conducted on a global scale, with a comparative analysis to assess differences between developed and non-developed countries.
